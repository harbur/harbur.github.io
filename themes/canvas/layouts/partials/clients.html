                <span>We help <a href="http://www.oneboxtm.com" ref="nofollow">Onebox</a> to migrate from a monolith application to a micro-service architecture decreasing the server costs by 30%.</span>
            </div>

            <p>By migrating the solutions to a microservice-oriented platform we greatly simplified configuration and shortened the time it takes to develop deploy and rollback. By porting the solutions to Docker containers we improved the consistency between the development, staging and production environments.</p>
